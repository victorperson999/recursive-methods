# recursive-methods
This project shows two examples of recursive methods and implementations of them.
This project explains how recursive methods work and how they are useful in some implementations of coding
the examples are getting the number in the Fibonacci sequence, and the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, with the user being able to input the number of rings on the first rod.
